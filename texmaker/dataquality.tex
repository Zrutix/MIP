We live in the era of Big Data. By looking at the statistics of globally generated data annually, we can 
see the increasing trend. If we compare the year 2010 and 2022 it shows us a difference of 95
zettabytes generated in a single year. However, the upward trajectory poses challenges in data 
quality. Consequently, the demand for realistic data sets, accurate and consistent information, and 
overall data quality has become a pressing concern. The paper aims to investigate the challenges 
related to testing in the context of Big Data adoption. It seeks to outline a testing strategy that can 
effectively validate the high volume, velocity, and variety of information associated with Big Data.\cite{gudivada2015big}\cite{mittal2013trustworthiness}
